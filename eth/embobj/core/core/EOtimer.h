/** @defgroup eo_timer Object EOtimer
    The EOtimer object is used to perform an action at the expiry of a countdown. The action
    is specified by the EOaction variable passed to the object at start of the timer and
    can be one of the following: send a message to a task, send an event to a task, ask a teask to
    perform a callback function.  
    The EOtimer can be programmed to execute the action in two ways: to executed only once at 
    the expiry of the countdown, or to execute it forever by retriggering the countdown.
    It is possible to have multiple EOtimer objects at the same time.  They are managed by a
    timer manager singleton derived from EOVtheTimerManager which must be properly initialised
    (and ticked for the single-task variant).

                absolute time specified by @e startat. After the first expiry, the timer can simply stop itself or restart the countdown

    @param      startat         If the value is equal to eok_abstimeNOW, then the coundown is started using the current
                                lifetime as absolute reference and the timer is NOT synchronised. If the timer is not synchronised,
                                in case of  a change of lifetime, then the countdown will not be changed.
                                If instead the value is different from eok_abstimeNOW (it can be even zero), then the timer starts
                                its countdown exactly at absolute time @e startat and will expire exactly at absolute time @e startat +
                                @e countdown. If mode is eo_tmrmode_FOREVER it will expire at any absolute time equal to @e startat +

    @param      countdown       The countdown in micro-seconds. If @e startat is not eok_abstimeNOW it must be > 0.
